# 3650proj
This project adds to the ALU project in both functionality and complexity, and puts your understanding of Chapter 4.4 to the test. Gain more experience and understanding in Verilog.

(The name denotes the availability of helpful (if you make it so) resources from countless people who have "been there, done that". But the skills, knowledge, and experience would still be beautiful when they finally become yours.)

Tasks

(100 pts) At a minimum, implement the single-cycle implementation as described in 4.4, handling the subset of instructions (ALU funcs, lw/sw, beq, jump) mentioned.
(20 pts) Implement 5-stage pipelining as shown in 4.7.
If you learned from some implementation on the Net, please list them in your README.md in your repo. Please also list what you learned from implementing the MIPS processor. Other information to be included in your README.md is the same as the last project (names, contributions, features).

$dumpfile and $dumpvars are how we make the vcd file to import into the gtkwave
Import vcd file into gtkwave and drag all the signals in the files
Need to click on graph to actually get the values
